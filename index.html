                Save the Children has worked in Africa for more than 60 years. Today, with millions of children and families in Africa already struggling to cope with the impacts of conflict and climate change, COVID19 is yet another shock undermining their livelihoods and pushing them towards acute hunger and malnutrition. In places like South Sudan and the Sahel, ongoing conflict has hindered families’ access to food for years. Across areas of East and Southern Africa, climate change has triggered harsher and more frequent droughts.

                Right now, Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are facing the third severe drought episode in a decade. West Africa is facing its worst food crisis in a decade, with 27 million people not knowing where their next meal will come from.
                
                Save the Children is responding to the immense needs of vulnerable African children and families by helping to improve access to healthcare and education. We are also working tirelessly to keep children protected from the harms of conflict, including child trafficking, forced early marriage and child labor.
                
                But we can’t do any of this lifesaving work without your support.
